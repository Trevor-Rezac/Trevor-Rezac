### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Trevor!

I am a Full-Stack Software Developer with a penchant for writing clean code and a focus on solving human centered problems through critical thinking and creativity. I am transitioning from a career mainly in customer service and bring with me a wealth of knowledge from my roles in the auto finance, collections, sales, and banking industries. I have a high level of attention to detail and take great pride in the quality of my work. I am highly adaptable and have excellent communication skills, both verbal and written. I have a thirst for knowledge and thrive when being challenged. I would enjoy being part of team of goal oriented, driven individuals who wish to make the world a better place.
